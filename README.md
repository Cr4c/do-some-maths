# Do some maths
A small website to learn basic math.

I made this to refresh and imporve my handling of basic math operations. 

To use it yourself, just open the index.html file with your browser of choice.  
Choose from operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and select their difficulty. Enter a username and start testing your prowess.  
After you're done you can see some stats on how well you did.
